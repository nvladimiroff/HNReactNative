A simple HN React Native client. Currently only supports Android. *Should* work on iOS, but I haven't tested this yet.

### Buiding
Make sure you have npm and node(>4.0) installed.
````
git clone https://github.com/nvladimiroff/HNReactNative.git
npm install -g react-native-cli
````

Then make sure $ANDROID_HOME is set and an emulator is running and run:
````
react-native run-android
````
